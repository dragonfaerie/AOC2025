<h3>Advent of Code</h3>

<i>This is just me doing the 2025 AoC challenges. This is all in Kotlin, reading from flat text files. Nothing fancy or
glamorous or cutting edge, just me working on my skills in a language I use daily at work.</i>

**Day 1**:
I do not sleep well so when I woke up a bit after 0300 I just sat down and worked through this. A little googling syntax
and an AI discussion later it's 0430 and this all is working.

**Day 2**:
Oops accidentally solved part b while doing part a, didn't realize it, so had to resolve part b when I got to part b
LOL. I really need to read all the details on the puzzle better.

**Day 3**:
"Joltage" lol. The hardest part here was NOT being able to sort as it's the highest pair IN ORDER not the two highest
numbers.

**Day 4**:
STRUGGLE BUSSSSS. I've never been great at these mapper type puzzles so I wound up using AI to explain concepts, best
practices, how to pick this apart. 

**Day 5**:
Yay iterators and counters and never ending loops oops oh my. This one was pretty straight forward.
