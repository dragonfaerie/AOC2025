<h3>Advent of Code</h3>

<i>This is just me doing the 2025 AoC challenges.  This is all in Kotlin, reading from flat text files.  Nothing fancy or glamorous or cutting edge, just me working on my skills in a language I use daily at work.</i>

**Day 1**: 
I do not sleep well so when I woke up a bit after 0300 I just sat down and worked through this.  A little googling syntax and an AI discussion later it's 0430 and this all is working.
